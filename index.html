			<p>For me, to be a <a href ="#projects" style="text-decoration: none; letter-spacing: 1px;color:#4C94CF; font-weight: bolder;">CREATOR</a> is to be someone who can change ideas into reality creatively and efficiently. Thinking outside of the box while utilizing today's advanced technology, I aim to innovate digital visual designs. This goal encouraged me to start my journey as an international student from Nepal and gain inspiration from my dynamic university life at the University of Central Florida (UCF).<br>
			<br>	
			As a fresh graduate of December 2020 from the College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS) at UCF, I am actively searching for positions in Web Development and Design. Having lived in Orlando for five years now, I have been continuously exposed to new cultures and diverse groups of people. This has made me able to quickly adapt to changes and learn about a variety of ideas and perspectives. Being a detail-oriented person, I keep my goals and tasks organized to track my productivity. I believe that the skills that I have attained from my studies and experience define me and I am looking forward to implementing and polishing them in any opportunity that I receive.</p>
